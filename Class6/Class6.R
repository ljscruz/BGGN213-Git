#what: a function is defined with: 
#a user selected name, 
#a comma separated set of input arguments and
#Regular R code for the function body
#how: Follow a step by step procedures to go ...
#....from working code snippet to refined and tested functions 
#1.start with simple problem, a snippet of code 
#2.rewrite for clarity and to reduce duplication
#3.then and ONLY then turn into an initial function
#4.test on small well defined input

#make a function with the label grade() to determine an overall grade from...
  #... a vector of student homework assignment scores dropping the 
  #...lowest single assignment score
#student 1
c(100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90)

#student 2
c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90,70,80)

#now grade all students in an example class
